# Gusty

A minimal atomic CSS stylesheet using dynamic utility ~~classes~~ attributes.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is an exploration of CSS data types and [Chrome 133 (beta)'s new "advanced" `attr()`](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/advanced-attr), inspired by [Jhey](https://jhey.dev)'s skeets on the topic [^1][^2]. Please don't take this too seriously!

Think [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) or [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/), but the utility classes (or attributes in Gusty's case) are declared only once in the stylesheet and can be used in any number of variations without requiring more generated CSS.

For the following HTML:

```html
<div class="px-8 px-6 px-4 px-2"></div>
```

Tailwind CSS would need to generate the following CSS, one `.px-` class for each different length value.

```css
.px-2 {
	padding-left: 0.5rem;
	padding-right: 0.5rem;
}
.px-4 {
	padding-left: 1rem;
	padding-right: 1rem;
}
.px-6 {
	padding-left: 1.5rem;
	padding-right: 1.5rem;
}
.px-8 {
	padding-left: 2rem;
	padding-right: 2rem;
}
```

Whereas for the following HTML (rough translation into Gusty's syntax):

```html
<div px="2rem" px="1.5rem" px="1rem" px="0.5rem"></div>
```

Gusty only requires as single declaration block for an infinite number of length values:

```css
[px] {
	padding-left: attr(px type(<length> | <percentage>));
	padding-right: attr(px type(<length> | <percentage>));
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> While Gusty only _needs_ this one declaration for all `px` attributes/classes, usage of the stylesheet would include all other utility attributes. This is unlike Tailwind CSS, which purges unused classes.

Gusty theoretically scales better with larger projects, since more variation of utility attributes usually (e.g. with Tailwind CSS) means more classes in the compiled stylesheet, whereas the Gusty stylesheet is always the same length.
